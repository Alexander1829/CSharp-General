//Пару слов о синглтоне
What makes you say that either a singleton or a static method isn't thread-safe? 
Usually both should be implemented to be thread-safe.

The big difference between a singleton and a bunch of static methods is that singletons can implement 
interfaces (or derive from useful base classes, although that's less common, in my experience)
, so you can pass around the singleton as if it were "just another" implementation.
